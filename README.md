## üõ†Ô∏è Skills

### Communication & Leadership
I developed strong communication and leadership skills while working at **HaysMac**, managing and coaching a team of analysts. My role required me to clearly communicate technical solutions, guide junior staff, and collaborate with stakeholders to ensure smooth operation of ITSM processes. These skills seamlessly translated into my software development journey‚Äîwhether it's explaining code concepts in team settings or pair programming sessions, I‚Äôm confident in keeping communication clear and effective.

### Problem Solving & Automation
During my time at **HW Fisher**, I identified inefficiencies in the laptop setup process and proactively developed a console application to streamline the process. The tool organized software installations by department, significantly reducing setup time and manual errors. This hands-on experience in solving real-world problems through automation sharpened my problem-solving mindset‚Äînow applied when building software solutions that improve workflows and efficiency.

### Process Management & Continuous Improvement
I took ownership of **Incident, Problem, and Change management processes**, ensuring they ran efficiently. I‚Äôm adept at following structured processes while spotting opportunities for improvement, such as extending ITSM systems like Freshservice. This process-driven approach now aids me in writing clean, maintainable code, following best practices like test-driven development, and continuously iterating on my projects.
